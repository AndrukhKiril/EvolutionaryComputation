# EvolutionaryComputation

The notebooks can be executed using [**your python virtual environment**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) via:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All the required modules do not have any implementations of solving TSP problems and are used for effective computations, visualizations and to run the notebooks.
